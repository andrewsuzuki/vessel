Vessel is a simple, yet powerful file-based CMS (content management system). Written in PHP, built on Laravel.

Currently in the early stages of development. See Roadmap below, or see Installation below to dive in.

### Goals

Vessel aims to be:

* Easy to set up and integrate. It should provide a low barrier to entry for CMS templating. The process for a newcomer to hook an HTML document into content management should be simple, and should not require knowledge of a server side language to get a site up and running. Powerful functionalities from the Laravel Blade templating language are available for use, such as [template extension](http://laravel.com/docs/templates#blade-templating).

* Be straightforward. The backend interface, styled with Twitter Bootstrap, should be easy enough for most users, including clients, to use.

* Be extensible. A number of wordpress-style hooks (actions and filters) should be made available for plugins. Plugins can leverage the power of Composer, and the Laravel framework.

* Be documented extensively, for templaters, plugin developers, and clients.

### Installation

If you're brave and/or would like to help out, here's how to install a workbench'd Vessel.

1. Create a new [Laravel installation](http://laravel.com/docs/installation). Configure to taste (url + database).
2. Run the following from your base laravel installation path:

```
$ mkdir -p workbench/hokeo/vessel
$ cd workbench/hokeo/vessel
$ git clone git://github.com/hokeo/vessel.git
$ composer update
$ cd ../../../
$ composer dump-autoload
$ php artisan migrate --bench=hokeo/vessel
$ php artisan db:seed --class=Hokeo\\Vessel\\Seeds\\TestVesselSeeder
$ php artisan asset:publish --bench=hokeo/vessel
$ php artisan dump-autoload
```

3. If you want to fiddle with different config variables from your app, run:

```
php artisan config:publish --path=workbench/hokeo/vessel/src/config/config.php hokeo/vessel
```

For testing, run `phpunit` from workbench/hokeo/vessel. Some bootstrapping hackery will ensue, for now.

Feel free to post any issues or comments here on github.
